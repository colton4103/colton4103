- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @colton4103
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things but specifically for GitHub, I am interested in creating useful tools and programs that will somehow make the world a better place.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Vue, Quasar, and Electron to make cross-platform apps and tools using the HTML and CSS knowledge I currently have.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I direct video for concerts as a side-hustle. My favorite concert I directed is Weird Al but the biggest attendended show is either Ozzy Osbourne or Blink-182.


I will be back to edit this but, I figured this would be a good enough start for anyone who stumbles upon this.
